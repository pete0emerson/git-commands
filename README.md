# Git commands I find useful

I've written these three git commands to automate frequently done tasks in a git repository.

`git-rm-branch` switches to main, does a git pull, and then removes the branch you started from (it prompts you).

`git-push-branch` pushes the current branch up to the origin, setting the upstream.

`git-open` opens the current repository (with subdirectories added, if appropriate) in your browser.
